A project to add Archipelago Manual support for killer7
# WHAT YOU'LL NEED

- A completed save file of killer7 ( I recommend the Steam version here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/868520/killer7/)

- My manual AP World and the client (Ovbiously) 

- UniversalTracker

# Items are:

- Targets

-  Soul Shells

- Odd Engravings

- Rings

-  Locked Smiths

# Checks Are

- Solving Puzzles

- Talking To Travis

- Picking Up Soul Shells

- Picking Up Odd Engravings

-  Killing Targets

# Goal:

- Kill The Past (Finish Target06: Lion)

# Entering Target06

To Enter Target06 you need a certain number of Targets Killed, which are obtained through, you guessed it, killing the targets of each of the games missions. Since I don't have settings for this yet, the number you'll need to enter Target06 is 4.
